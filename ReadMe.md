## Inspiration
Getting started in web3 seemed to be kind of confusing to most builders. Most don't seem to get building on the ecosystem as quickly as expected and these are the hindrance a lot of builders doesn't seem to have a way across such as 
    - Getting NFT data from the blockchain causes having fewer NFT dApps on the ecosystem
    - Getting Token Data from the blockchain causes having less/lower de-fi dashboard or aggregator on the ecosystem. 
    - And a lot is mentioned by users, this causing kind of lesser and slower dApp development on the ecosystem 
 
## What it does 
TDK is built to simplify the processes of integrating Web3 into any tech stack by following easy guides, recipes, and API references, which also build faster and smarter with APIs that bridge the development gap between Web2 and Web3

## How we built it
We are able to query some blockchain data that are persistent to be cached for reliability and quick response from the request. Used some API as a helper to process some data before querying the blockchain running some requests simultaneously to speed up the rate of response.

## Challenges we ran into
- Running a BTFS node in handling data
- Caching blockchain data increasing the speed of each request
- Querying the blockchain for larger information

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Being able to get the MVP up and running
- React SDK in beta to be published by Q4 this year

## What we learned
- Running some nodes such as BTFS to handle file upload
- Querying the blockchain for large data 

## What's next for Tron Development Kit ( TDK )
- Get a lot of developers onboarded to build on the TRON  ecosystem with a simplified tool.
- Full Launch by Q1 2023 
- Improve infrastructure for consistent, accurate, and faster results.
